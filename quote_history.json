Every moment you choose healing over hiding, connection over isolation, you're not just getting better, you're becoming who you were always meant to be. Your struggles don't define your worth; your courage to keep going despite them reveals the unbreakable strength that was inside you all along.",

The person you're becoming doesn't need to apologize for the person you used to be\u2014they were both doing the best they could with what they had. Trust the quiet work happening beneath the surface; healing grows in its own time, and you are already blooming in ways you may not yet recognize.",
